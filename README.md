Tree Detection with YOLOv11 🌳🔎
This repository provides a solution for detecting trees in images using YOLOv11, optimized for high-speed and precise identification. The model is fine-tuned using a curated dataset from Roboflow, designed for efficient tree detection across various scenarios. Ready for deployment, this tool can detect trees with minimal setup.

🚀 Key Features
YOLOv11 Real-Time Detection: Achieves quick and accurate tree detection.
Trained on Roboflow Dataset: Utilizes a high-quality, pre-processed dataset for reliable performance.
Batch & Real-Time Inference: Capable of handling both bulk image processing and live predictions.
Bounding Boxes: Provides clear bounding boxes around each detected tree.
Customizable Confidence Threshold: Control the sensitivity of tree detection with an adjustable confidence setting.
📂 Dataset Information
The model is trained using a dataset obtained from Roboflow. Ensure you download and extract the dataset to the correct location for both training and testing.

🛠 Installation & Setup Guide
To get started, install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install ultralytics roboflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Then, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tree-detection-yolov11.git
cd tree-detection-yolov11
🔧 Model Training Instructions
Train the YOLOv11 model with the dataset:

bash
Copy
!yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov11.pt data=dataset.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
🔍 Making Predictions
To detect trees in new images, use the following command:

bash
Copy
!yolo task=detect mode=predict model={HOME}/runs/detect/train3/weights/best.pt \
     conf=0.25 source={dataset.location}/test/images save=True
This command will process the input images and save the results, displaying bounding boxes around detected trees.

📊 Performance & Evaluation
The model demonstrates strong accuracy on test datasets. It also includes visualizations of performance metrics like mAP, precision, and recall. Real-time video inference is also supported.

📌 Future Enhancements
Expanded Dataset Training: Fine-tune the model on a larger dataset to improve accuracy.
Real-Time Video Detection: Implement continuous tree detection on video streams.
Optimizing for Edge Devices: Improve inference speed to enable deployment on devices with limited computational resources.
